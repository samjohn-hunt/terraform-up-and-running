# Terraform Learning Project

This repository tracks my hands-on learning with **Terraform** and AWS, following *Terraform: Up & Running*.  
The focus is on understanding how infrastructure-as-code behaves in practice, not just getting examples to work.

## Progress So Far

- Installed and configured Terraform on Windows
- Set up AWS authentication (IAM user + AWS CLI)
- Learned Terraform’s core workflow:
  - `terraform init`
  - `terraform plan`
  - `terraform apply`
  - `terraform destroy`
- Provisioned and destroyed my **first EC2 instance** using Terraform
- Gained practical understanding of:
  - AMIs vs instance types
  - Free Tier constraints and cost awareness
  - AWS regions and region mismatches
- Initialised Git and applied Terraform-specific version control best practices
